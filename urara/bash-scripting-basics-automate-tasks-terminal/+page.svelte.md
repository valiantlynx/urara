If you're a terminal user, you know how tedious it can be to manually execute the same commands repeatedly. But what if I told you there's a way to automate these tasks and free up your time for more important things? Welcome to the exciting world of bash scripting!

Bash scripting is a powerful tool that lets you automate tasks in the terminal. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this guide will show you the basics of how to unleash your productivity with bash scripting.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Print the message to the console
echo "Hello, world!"

# Store the result of the ls command in a variable
files=$(ls)

#Print the result
echo $files
```

First, let's dive into logging into a server using the **ssh** command. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing you to remotely run commands on the server and automate tasks even when you're not physically present.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
echo "Logging into the server!"

# Log into the server and run the setup.sh script
ssh -i news_site.pem ubuntu@15.152.49.209 'bash -s' < setup.sh

echo "Done!"
```

Next, we'll show you how to run a bash script located on the server you just logged into. Trust me, once you see the power of running scripts on a remote server, you'll be hooked!
  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
echo "Logging into the server!"

# Log into the server and run the setup.sh script
ssh -i news_site.pem ubuntu@15.152.49.209 'bash /path/to/setup.sh'

echo "Done!"
```

And finally, we'll talk about the importance of adding comments to your bash scripts. Comments serve as a roadmap, helping you understand the purpose of your code and making it easier to maintain in the future. Plus, they help others understand your code too, making collaboration a breeze.
